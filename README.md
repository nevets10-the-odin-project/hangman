# Project: Hangman

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-hangman

## Introduction

Files are a great way to save and reload a game, so we’ll give it a shot here by building Hangman.

You will be building a command line Hangman game where one player plays against the computer, but a bit more advanced.

## Post-project review

I think this project went a lot smoother than the previous ones. My brainstorming ideas were a lot closer to what I ended up with, which is awesome!

I don't know how long I'll struggle with context switching between different languages... I keep using JavaScript syntax when calling hash keys.
